\title{Create 'Flame' Ploygons.}
\usage{
geom_flame(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link{aes}} or
\code{\link{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
   options:

   If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
   data as specified in the call to \code{\link{ggplot}}.

   A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
   data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
   \code{\link{fortify}} for which variables will be created.

   A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
   the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame.}, and
   will be used as the layer data.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with
a warning. If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link{borders}}.}

\description{
This function will create polygons between two lines. If given a
temperature and theshold time series, like that produced by \code{\link{detect}},
the output will meet the specifications of Hobday et al. (2016) shown as
'flame polygons'. If one wishes to plot polygons below a given threshold, and not
above, switch the values being fed to the \code{y} and \code{y2}
aesthetics. This function differs in use from \code{\link{event_line}}
in that it must be created as a \code{ggplot} 'geom' object. The benefit
of this being that one may add additional information to the figure as geom
layers to ggplot2 graphs as may be necessary.

\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_flame} understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics
are in bold):
\itemize{
  \item \strong{\code{x}}
  \item \strong{\code{y}}
  \item \strong{\code{y2}}
  \item \code{colour}
  \item \code{fill}
  \item \code{size}
  \item \code{alpha}
  \item \code{linetype}
}
}

\examples{
t_dat <- make_whole(sst_WA)
res <- detect(t_dat, climatology_start = 1983, climatology_end = 2012)
mhw <- res$clim
mhw <- mhw[10580:10690,]

\dontrun{
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(mhw, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y2 = thresh_clim_year)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date("2011-02-01"), y = 28,
  label = "That's not a heatwave.\\nThis, is a heatwave.")) +
  xlab("Date") + ylab(expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")))
}
